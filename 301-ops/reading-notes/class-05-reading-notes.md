1. **What is a site-to-site VPN?**
   - A site-to-site virtual private network (VPN) refers to a connection set up between multiple networks. Site-to-site VPNs are useful for companies that want private, protected traffic, and helpful for organizations with more than one office spread out over large geographical locations.
2. **What is TCP/IP and what is it used for?**
   - TCP/IP outlines how data is organized according to packets, given addresses, transmitted, and received across different devices on the internet.
3. **What are some popular reasons for using a VPN?**
   - VPNs gained popularity because of people wanting to mask their IP addresses and surf the internet more safely; allowing them to download torrents without revealing who you are, access to geo-locked content, and an encrypted connected that adds another layer of security against cyberthreats.
4. **Explain the difference between the three types of VPNs.**
   - **Remote Access VPNs** - Remote access VPNs refer to a temporary connection between two or more users and a central location, such as a data center.
   - **Intranet-based Site-to-Site** - Connects more than one local area network (LAN) to form a wide-area network (WAN). Useful for combining resources housed in disparate offices securely.
   - **Extranet-based Site-to-Site** - Used by two or more companies that want to share certain resources but keep others private. With extranet-base site-to-site, each entity connects to the VPN and chooses what they want to make avialable to others.
