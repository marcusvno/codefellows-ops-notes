1. **What occurred during the same time as the beginning of the decline of women in computer science?**
   - The decline of women in computer science began around 1984, coinciding with the time when personal computers started becoming common in U.S. homes. These early personal computers were primarily marketed to men and boys, often being portrayed as toys or tools for them. This gendered marketing contributed to a narrative that computing and computers were primarily for males, which influenced societal and cultural perceptions about who belonged in the field of computer science.
2. **Why does it matter that males had been playing on computers growing up?**
   - The early and more frequent exposure of males to computers during their growing up years mattered because it created a significant experience gap between the genders. By the time students reached college, many male students had considerable experience with computers, having used them at home for years. This experience gave them an advantage in computer science courses, where professors increasingly assumed a certain level of familiarity with computers. This gap could lead to discouragement and a feeling of being out of place in computer science courses and, by extension, the field, contributing to the decline in female participation.

**Ask the question:** Why diversity matters to your tech company ([article](https://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/columnist/2015/07/21/why-diversity-matters-your-tech-company/30419871/))

1. **When are diversity efforts most successful?**
   - Diversity efforts are most successful when they're driven by a commitment from company leaders.
2. **Why do diverse companies perform better?**
   - By attracting diverse candidates and designing interviewing processes that ensure a level playing field, companies have a better chance of ensuring the best idea is at the table.
3. **Give an example of how a diverse company can serve a diverse user base or vise-versa.**
   - YouTube's app was made mostly by right-handed people, and they didn't think about left-handed users. This led to some videos being uploaded upside down. This shows that having a team that's diverse, like your users, helps make products that work well for everyone.
