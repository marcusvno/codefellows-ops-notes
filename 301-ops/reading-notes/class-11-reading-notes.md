1. **What is a server, and how is it different from a regular computer? How would you describe this difference to a friend who doesnâ€™t know much about computers?**
   - A regular computer installation of Windows 10 is designed to be used in person while a Server is a computer that runs services for people across a network. While both can have a desktop GUI, it is recommended (and standard) for servers to operate completely from the CLI.
   - A Windows Server is like a professional chef's kitchen in a restaurant, designed for large-scale cooking and serving many customers at once. It's optimized for reliability, security, and managing multiple tasks, making it ideal for businesses.
   - Windows 10 is like a home kitchen, suitable for everyday cooking needs. It's user-friendly, designed for personal use, and doesn't have the advanced features needed for running a restaurant.
2. **How does the way Windows Server receives updates differ from Windows Home and Pro?**
   - Windows Servers updates are focused on stability and and happen less frequent than that of desktop environments, which focus on security and adding new features and arrive more frequently.
3. **Does Windows Server have different hardware requirements than Windows Home or Pro?**
   - Yes, due to this Windows Servers have much larger hardware capabilities as well, being able to use up to 24 TB of RAM, and 64 CPUs, a vast improvement over the 2TB and 1 or 2 CPU limits of Windows Home and Pro.
