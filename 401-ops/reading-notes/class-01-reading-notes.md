## Questions

1. **How would you convince your future company to pursue SOC2 compliance?**
    - To convince a future company to pursue SOC2 compliance, it's important to emphasize that SOC 2 is a framework applicable to any service provider storing customer data in the cloud. It's particularly relevant for SaaS businesses, especially those selling to enterprises.  Enterprises are often beholden to a wide variety of security and compliance controls, and being demonstrably SOC 2 compliant as a vendor gives those enterprise customers the peace of mind. 
2. **What are the five SOC2 Trust Principles?**
    - The five SOC2 Trust Principles are:
        - *Security:* The foundational principle common to all audits.
        - *Confidentiality:* Protection against unauthorized disclosure of sensitive data.
        - *Availability:* Ensuring that systems or data are accessible as agreed or required.
        - *Integrity:* Safeguarding that systems or data are not altered in an unauthorized way.
        - *Privacy:* Protection of the use, collection, retention, disclosure, and disposal of personal information
3. **How would your explain the three levels of the SOC2 pyramid in an analogy your friends or former colleagues would understand?**
    - The three levels of the SOC2 pyramid - Policies, Procedures, and Proof - could be seen as similar breakdown of cooking a dish.
        - *Policies* are your recipe book. It contains all the essential guidelines and standards, like recipes, which determine how different dishes (security practices) should be prepared and what ingredients (protocols) are needed.
        - *Procedures* represents the actual cooking process. It's how you follow the recipes in the book, step-by-step, to create a dish. This includes the specific actions and techniques used to ensure the dish (data management and security practices) turns out as intended.
        - *Proof* is akin to the finished dish and its presentation. It's the tangible evidence that the recipe was followed correctly and the dish was prepared as it should be. This includes documentation and records that show adherence to the policies and procedures, much like how a well-prepared dish demonstrates a cook's adherence to the recipe.

## Things I Want to Know More About

The article discusses SOC 1 and 2. Are there more SOC levels? With each one does security become more intense and restrictive? At what point does that security hamper work activity?
