## Reconnaissance
- What is penetration testing ([article](https://www.imperva.com/learn/application-security/penetration-testing/))

## Questions

1. **How are the stages of a pen test very similar to those of the Cyber Kill Chain?**
    - The Pentest Cycle is, in broad strokes, similar to the Kill Chain: it has steps of reconning the target, gaining access through exploitation of vulnerabilities, attempting to get persistence, but while the Kill Chain's final steps are establishing C2 and actions on objective, the Pentest cycle compiles and analyzes what they've accomplished at this point to fix vulnerabilities before proceeded with new tests.  
2. **Your manager has asked you to explain the benefits of a pentest to the companyâ€™s leadership. How would you lead this conversation?**
    - While costly, a pentest is can reveal vulnerabilities and gaps in the company's defenses that can cost millions in ransomware costs, reputational damage, and perhaps irrecoverable data loss. Better to test and shore up the most blatant vulnerabilities than try and survive the worst case scenario.
