## Protecting Data at Rest with Device Encryption
Data Protection: Data In transit vs. Data At Rest- ([article](https://www.digitalguardian.com/blog/data-protection-data-in-transit-vs-data-at-rest))

## Questions

1. **From your day to day computer use, provide examples of when data is at rest and when it is in transit.**
    - My notes, reading assignment, and code files are at rest when I am not directly using or editing them. They are in transit when I access them to edit (RAM), running a script, or transmitting them to be backed up on github.
2. **Explain the role data encryption with regards to the CIA triad.**
    - Data Encryption is about maintaining *confidentiality* of data so that threat actors cannot break the privacy of that data and the *integrity* of data, as encryption, commonly, ensures that no one can edit the data without decrypting it first.
