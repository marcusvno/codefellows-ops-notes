## Cyber Risk Analysis

- Security and Risk Management ([article](https://resources.infosecinstitute.com/certifications/cissp/security-risk-management/))

## Questions

1. **Consider a bank ATM that allows users to access bank account balances. What measures can the ATM incorporate to cover the principles of the CIA triad?**
    - *Confidentiality*: More privacy protections of when someone accesses an ATM. Perhaps a booth?
    - *Integrity*: ATM cards requiring multi-factor authentication beyond simply a PIN to access the bank account balance.
    - *Availability*: Constant maintenance and security on the ATM itself.

2. **Name three best practices that support the CIA triad.**
    - **Least privilege**: Allowing users to have only the required access to do their jobs. (Role-based Permissions)
    - **Need to Know**: Allowing users to have only required access to do their jobs. (Role-based access)
    - **Dual control**: Requiring more than one user to perform a task. (Accounting)

3. **What are the three stages of the risk management lifecycle? What is each stage’s main goal or objective?**
    1. *Risk assessment*
        - Looks at risks corresponding to identified parameters and must be reevaluated periodically.
    2. *Risk Analysis*
        - Risk analyzed through a *qualitative* and *quantitative* lens.
        - *Qualitative* analysis is subjective in nature and uses words like “high,” “medium,” “low” to describe the likelihood and severity of the impact of a threat exposing a vulnerability.
        - *Quantitative* analysis is objective and numbers-driven. It requires more experience than qualitative analysis and involves calculations to determine a dollar value associated with each risk element. Business decisions are fundamentally driven by this type of analysis.
    3. *Mitigating Risk*
        - Risk mitigation comes in three responses:
          - Reduce: Take the appropriate steps to reduce the amount of possible risk you are vulnerable to. This can be expensive and restrictive.
          - Tranfer: Transfer the risk to a third party, similar to the shared responsibility model used with AWS (and other) Cloud Services.
          - Accept: Accept the risk and its consequences, similar to Walmart's acceptance of a certain level of theft occurs in its stores.
