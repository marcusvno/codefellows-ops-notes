## Questions

1. **Explain CloudWatch Events to a non-technical friend.**
    - Like a smoke detector, CloudWatch Events keeps track of things in the cloud and can raise an alarm when certain criteria are met. 
2. **What do CloudWatch Logs helps us achieve?**
    - CloudWatch Logs helps collect and monitor logs from AWS resources and presents them in a searchable form and setup real-time alerts.
3. **What capabilities does CloudWatch Anomaly detection have?**
    - Applies statiscal and machine learning algorithms that continuously analyze metrics of systems or applications and determine baselines and when things are operating outside of those baselines. Includes the following capabilities:
      - Learn and model the expected behaviour of a metric based on prior data.
      - Calculate expected values and generates the Anomaly Detection band. This is based on a lower and upper band metric generated by the band. Metrics that fall outside of this band are marked as anomalies.
      - Enables you to create alarms based on the Anomaly Detection band and remediate detected anomalies.
      - AWS API & CloudFormation support.
