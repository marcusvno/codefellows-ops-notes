2. **How would you explain, to a non-technical friend, the role PKI plays in protecting traffic between your browser and a web server.**
   - PKI is similar to a system of checking, issuing, and maintaining passports to gain access to different locations. When you visit a server (like visiting a country), your password (certificate) is checked to see if it is valid before entry. This ensures that the connection is secure and private and protects you from a variety of confidentiality and integrity attacks.
3. **What is the main weakness of the PKI architecture?**
   - The main weakness of public PKI is that any certificate authority can sign a certificate for any person or computer. Intelligence agencies, authoritarian or hostile governments, can use fraudulent certificates for espionage, malware injection, and forging messages or evidency to disrupt or discredit adversaries.
