## Questions

1. **How would a security team benefit from implementing a SOAR solution?**
    - SOAR (security automation and orchestration) products are purpose-built tools that orchestrate activities between other security tools and perform specific automation activities in response to identified threats. The benefit of implementing such a solution is to automate mundane and repeatable tasks (things that computers excel) to allow businesses and individuals to concentrate on more productive problem solving activities.
    - Additionally, automation can help with lean or ill-proportioned cybersecurity teams who are strapped for resources to deal with the growing digital footprint of the organization. Particularly as the org's footprint expands it broadens it's overall attack surface from a corporate espionage perspective.
    - Teams can focus on projects such as:
      - Security engineering and architecture.
      - Remediation Activities
      - Automation Development and Engineering.
2. **Explain how a SOAR solution fits into the Incident Response process.**
    - Automated incident response capabilities can accelerate your incident response processes, such as blocking, containing, detecting, or otherwise reacting to threats in a rapid manner. This creates a more efficient use of human manhours to dealing with incidents.
