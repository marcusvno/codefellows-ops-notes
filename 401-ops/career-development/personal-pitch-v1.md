# Personal Pitch

Hello, I’m Marcus Nogueira, and my professional journey has been driven by a passion for both design and technology. With a foundation in graphic design, I have a deep appreciation for the aesthetics and user experience aspects of digital products. This background laid the groundwork for my next venture, where I embraced the technical side of the web through a full-stack development bootcamp.

Completing the bootcamp was a transformative experience, significantly enhancing my technical skills and exposing me to the intricate workings of web applications. This newfound knowledge and skillset sparked a specific interest in cybersecurity, leading me to pursue a focused career in this field. I am currently engaging in specialized cybersecurity studies at Code Fellows, where I am dedicated to understanding and mitigating the digital threats facing today’s technology.

My unique journey from graphic design to full-stack development, and now to cybersecurity, gives me a multifaceted perspective on digital projects. I’m not just looking to create visually appealing and functional web solutions; I’m equally committed to ensuring they are secure and resilient against threats. I am excited about the opportunity to bring this comprehensive blend of design, development, and security expertise to a team that values innovative and well-rounded approaches to technology.
