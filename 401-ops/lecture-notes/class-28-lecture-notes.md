# Class 28 - Atomic Testing

- **Why is security testing important?**
  - Proactively identifies and addresses vulnerabilities.
  - Simulates real-world attack scenarios.
  - Enhances the ability to detect and respond to security indicents.
  - Helps defenders adapt to the evolving global cyber threat landscape.

**Atomic Testing** is a way to automate and simulate a real-world attack, particularly useful for organizations that do not have the budget for hiring a third-party pentest firm nor the resources to dedicate significant portions of the security team to penetration or vulnerability testing.
