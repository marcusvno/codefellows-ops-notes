   - A professional kitchen is all about trying to achieve maximum efficiency and, more importantly, consistency under any customer load, whether during a sudden rush or a slow afternoon between lunch and dinner rush. The way this commonly done is through a strict use of specialized roles, prepared ingredients, and precisely placed and measure *mise en place* 
       - *Mise en place* is French for "everything in its place".
   - The *mise en place* is the routine and procedure that determines almost everything else in the kitchen as it determines the specific amounts of ingredients necessary for the day and determines what the prep crew will have to replenish. It also accounts for where ingredients are stored, ovens and fryer temperatures, and even the location of pots, pans, plates, knives, and towels so that regardless of which line cook or chef walks into the kitchen they can find everything fast and easy as well as placing ingregredients near one another as needed by the recipes being made.
