## CompTIA A+ 220-902 Troubleshooting Methodology ([link](https://www.professormesser.com/free-a-plus-training/220-902/how-to-troubleshoot/))

### Flowchart:

1. Identify the Problem
2. Establish a Theory
3. Test the Theory
4. Evaluate Results: Is it working?
   - If it isn't fixed, start over.
   - If it's working, continue.
5. Establish a Plan of Action
6. Implement Plan
7. Verify Full System Functionality
8. Document Findings

It works! Yay!

#### Identify the Problem
- **Information Gathering**
   - Get as many details as possible.
   - Duplicate the issue, if possible.
- **ID symptoms**
   - May be more than a single symption.
- **Question users**
   - Best sourse of details
- **Determine if anything has changed**
- **Approach multiple problems individually**
   - Break down problems into smaller pieces.

#### Establish Theory
- **Start with the obvious**
   - Occam's razor applies: prefer the simplest explanation is often the most likely.
- **Consider everything**
   - Even the not so obvious
- **Make a list of the possible causes**
   - Start with the easy theories 
   - And the least difficult to test.

#### Test the Theory 
- **Confirm the theory***
    - Determine next steps to resolve problem
- **Theory didn't work?**
    - Re-establish new theory or escalate. 

#### Plan of Action
- **Build the plan**
   - Correct the issue with a minimum of impact
   - Some issues can't be resolved during production hours
- **Identify potential effects**
   - Every plan can go bad.
   - Have a plan B
   - And a plan C

#### Implement Plan
- **Fix the Issue**
   - Implement during the change control window.
- **Escalate as necessary**
   - You may need help from a 3rd party if the control window is tight or complicated.

#### Verify Full System Functionality
- **It isn't fix until it's really fixed**
   - The test should be part of the plan
   - Have your customer confirm the fix
- **Implement preventative measures**
   - Let's avoid this issue in the future

#### Document Findings
- **Add to Knowledge Base**
   - Don't lose valuable knowledge!
- **Consider a formal database**
   - Help desk case notes
   - Searchable database




## Questions

1. **What should you do if multiple issues are happening simultaneously during troubleshooting?**
   - If there are multiple symptoms or problems, it is beast to try and solve one at a time. Break down it down into smaller pieces and deal with the more critical ones immediately. This may allow you to triangulate the source of issues or determine what problems are due to the same issue or are separate issues.
2. **What should be done once a successful solution has been identified during the troubleshooting process?**
   - Once a successful solution has been identified, form a plan of action, implement the fix, and verify that the system's functionality has been fully restored. Finally, implement any preventative measures if possible and document the fix in case the problem, or something similar, happens again and others (as well as yourself) have a good starting point for tackling it.
3. **What are the benefits of documenting the entire troubleshooting process in a knowledge base?**
   - A knowledge base is great so that any tech, whether they've seen a problem before or not, has a searchable database that they can use to help them deal with problems quickly with solutions that have worked in the past. It also allows you have a ton of fixes on hand that may be applicable to similar cases.
4. **Think about a technological device particularly popular in your culture or community. Imagine a scenario where issues arise: how would you apply CompTIA A+ troubleshooting methodology to help, while considering the end-user's cultural background**
   - After Effects is the industry standard when it comes to motion graphics but it can be difficult to design and think of an animation and bring it to life. The CompTIA A+ troubleshooting methodology would be helpful in breaking down the elements of the executing the animation into actionable chunks: Focus on a single axis of movement first, add new directions/axis after the last one is dealt with, add any opacity changes, etc. Work through the layers of effects and eventually you'll have the final product as you envisioned!
