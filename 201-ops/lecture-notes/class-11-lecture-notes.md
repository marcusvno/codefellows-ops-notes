# Class 11- Data Restoration, Startup Repair, and Secure Disposal

## Data Restoration and Recovery 

**Replication** of data from redundant source:
- **Backups**
- **Parity** copies (such as RAID arrays)

**Recreation** of some or all of the data:
- **Regeneration** of data by the original means
  - Regenerating only corrupted portions of the data (faster but less assured)
- Use of AI tools to predictively reproduce the data.

## When Data is Accidentally Deleted

When data is deleted, the **OS updates the file system record** to mark the portion of the disk occupted by that data as available.
