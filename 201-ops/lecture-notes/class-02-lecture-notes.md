# Class 02 Lecture Notes

## Comprehensive vs Specific Backups 

- *More Comprehensive* 
   - **Bare Metal Backup:**
      - Complete backup of an entire system, including the operating system, applications, settings, and data. 
   - **Image-based Backup:**
      - Creating a complete image or copy of a specific system or disk at a specific point in time.

- *More Specific:*
   - **System Restore Point:**
      - Snapshot of the system's configuration and settings, created by the operating system. (Windows Restore Tool)
   - **File Backups:**
      - Copying individual files and folders, usually selected by the user, to a separate storage location. (Github, Google Drive, etc) 

## Dev Tools 

### Development Stack

**A Developer Needs:**
- Somewhere to write and run code
   - Development environment
- Tools to:
   - Write the code
      - Text editor
   - Navigate the file system
   - Track changes to the code. 

**NOTE:** VS Code's built-in terminal is an *terminal emulator* and not a real terminal and may operate differently in certain circumstances.

### git

**Git** is a version control program and utilitzed for sharing code and collaboration. 
- Git takes snapshots of your code at points in time. 
- Keeps a history of what those snapshots and the changes between them.
- Git has a special label, called HEAD, that means "You Are Here"
- Good practices means giving each snapshot a good descriptive message (known as a commit).

## Shell Scripting

- Shells are macro processors that execute commands
- Text and symbols are expanded to create larger expressions
- Inputs and Outputs of commands can be directed, allowing the creation of complex operations.
   - Commands can take inputs from a user, from a file,
