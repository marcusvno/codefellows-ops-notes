## Questions:

    - Equal conversational participation where all team members have a voice.
    - High social sensitivity and empathy among team members.
    - A culture of mutual trust where risks are encouraged and not penalized.
2. **Evaluate, with details, a previous professional setting (or team) you were in with regards to psychological safety.**
    - In my job as a professional chef, the executive chef did a great job in engaging with every single one of the people working in the back of the house on a personal level, regardless of their experience level. As a soldier, I had a Captain that made it a point to speak extensively with every soldier in his command and to remember something about them and their personal lives or goals.  
3. **What impact do teams that operate with a high degree of psychological safety have on their company and the team members?**
    - Teams with high psychological safety contribute to a company's success by cerating an environment that promotes innovation, engagement, and satisfaction. For team members, this environment gives them a feeling of support and acknowledges their strengths while working on improving their weaknesses, allowing them feel valued and important to the overall success of the team.
