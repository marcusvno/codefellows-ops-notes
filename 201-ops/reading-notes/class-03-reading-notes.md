## Introduction to Help Desk Support Roles ([link](https://www.pearsonitcertification.com/articles/article.aspx?p=2260779&seqNum=5))

1. **What roles does the help desk professional play within an organization, particularly in relation to customers?**
   - The Help Desk professional is often the "face" of the IT staff that customers see and interact with and are often the first line of support a customer has when they experience a problem. 
2. **The article differentiates betweens hard and soft skills. In your culture or community, are there specific skills that are highly valued? How do they compare to the skills mentioned in the article?**
   - In the professional kitchen, interaction with the customer (during working hours) is likely to be nonexistent and therefore there is not a lot of emphasis put on soft skills. In fact, I would say that due the time sensitive and high pressure situation of professional kitchens, soft skills are almost always less favored in leiu of hard technical skills. Blunt and direct communuication is preferred along with high technical skill since a kitchen's line works in tandem and is only as fast, or as good, as it's slowest or least precise cook. Mistime a dish and something will go out at the wrong time or, worse, cold, and if it gets sent back, that can wreck the rhythm of working through a dinner rush. 
3. **Why have security skills become more important in recent years for help desk technicians?**
   - As the internet has been more entrenched in our every day lives, the number of attack vectors for threat actors has risen dramatically. Subsequently, this has risen the number of incidents that happen, leading to help desk technicians being needed, more than ever, to be able to diagnose and resolve a malware attack. Understanding vulnerabilities, threats, and risks means it is much more likely that employeers will be able to resolve an issue as well as implement successful organizational security policies. 
4. **How do writing skills and critical thinking skills play a vital role in the work of help desk technicians?**
   - Along with the rise in threat actors, there has been a rise in complexity of systems, this has led to organizations creating and maintaining searchable knowledge bases and documentation so that techs and admins can search for common problems and how to resolve them. For these databases to be useful, technicians must be able to document things well and strng writing skills is what makes that possible. 
   - The IT field is one of ever evolving problems and it is likely that a technician in the field will encounter a problem they've never faced before in either a learning or professional environment. Being able to think critically about new situations is what allows for a technician to find solutions in such an everchanging landscape.
