## SSD Data Recovery Best Practices ([link](https://www.n-able.com/blog/ssd-data-recovery-best-practices))

1. **What are some common indicators that an SSD may be failing?**
    - The symptions of SSD failing can be:
      - Saving, reading, moving files may result in failure.
      - Active applications may operate slowly or frequently crash.
      - The system may prompt the user to repair the file syste,. 
      - Large file performance will decreas over time.
2. **How do SSD failures differ from HDD failures in terms of detectability?**
    - HDDS are made of spinning disks. Due to their moving parts you can sometimes hear audible signals as the drive deteriotes over time and nears failure: whirring, click, or humming. SSDs have no moving parts and therefore won't exhibit these audible indicators of immeninent failure.
3. **What are bad blocks in an SSD, and how do they affect its performance?**
    - **Bad Blocks** - All forms of storage are vulnerable to bad memory. In an SSD, this takes the form of *bad blocks* -- storage that through memory corrupt, or physical damage, impede data storage and retrieval.
4. **How can power cycling an SSD help resolve certain issues?**
    - If the source of the problem isn't physical but logical -- bad blocks, software malfuctions, malware, outdated firmware, etc. -- then a possible source may habve been a corruptiuon through power failure. Power cycling may help with righting this error as it forces a reset of the drive's controller, firmware, and cache. 
5. **How might this topic be relevant in the aftermath of a natural disaster? Describe how individuals or communities can use these techniques to recover data and resume their normal activities.**
    - Depending on the natural disaster, it may be possible to recover data from a SSD or have them functional enough to transfer data to a new undamaged drive. Knowing the tools to inspect drives can help determine what drives are salvagable and which aren't and save time in recovery procedures.
