## Malware Remediation Tools and Techniques ([link](https://www.pcworld.com/article/478239/how-to-remove-malware-from-your-windows-pc.html))

. **What are the main differences between anti-virus and anti-malware software?**
    - Anti-virus software is typically a real-time preventative measure and focuses on removing or blocking viruses. As such it may not classify or considering annoying adware or spyware as threats. Anti-malware typically has a broader definition of things to look out for and remove.
. **What are some signs or symptoms that may indicate a malware infection on your PC?**
    - Ad pop ups, web browsing is unpredictable or takes you to the wrong websites, slow performance.
. **Explain the difference between a full system scan and a quick scan when using antimalware software.**
    - A quick scan will scan the places that malware or viruses are most commonly found. A quick scan may take a few minutes. A full system scan examines as much of the computer as possible and can take hours to complete.
. **What should you do if your computer is infected with ransomware?**
    - Wipe it or buy new hardware.
. **Compare and contrast malware removal techniques in Windows PCs with those in other operating systems like macOS or Linux. How might these different approaches reflect the cultural values and priorities of the technology users?**
    - Window's market dominance means it is the most attractive target for threat actors. With its product being so customer focused (hence the market share), Windows leaves protection up to strong third-party software and preventative user measures. Linux, on the other hand, gives an extraordinary amount of control to the user. With Linux, you can customize almost everything in the system and the OS assumes a certain level of technical know-how to make the most of its systems and software environment as well being cognizant of the repositories you trust to install software on your computer. MacOS, like the iPhone App Store, is a wall garden with strong built-in system security and defenses, meaning that viruses are significantly rarer than in Windows.
