## Imaging, Backup, and Recovery ([link](https://www.ninjaone.com/blog/what-is-backup-and-disaster-recovery-and-why-do-you-need-it/))

1. **What is Backup and Disaster Recovery (BDR), and why is it essential for businesses?**
    - **Backup and Disaster Recovery** is the process of copying and storing data in a specific location, which can then be used for recovering or restoring that data when an emergency occurs. 
2. **Describe the process of data backup in detail.**
    - Data backups is the process of story a copy of a business's data either in the cloud or another physical environment, such an external hard drive. 
3. **What does disaster recovery refer to, and why is it crucial to have it in addition to data backups?**
    - Disaster recovery, on the otherhand, refers to the policies, procedures, and SOPs set up by an organization's cybersecurity structure to maintain business continuity in the event of a security incident. Should the main operation be taken offline, disaster recovery would spin up the latest backup to continue operations through the use of redudant servers or data backups offsite stored in a cold site. While backups and distaster recovery are often lumped together -- and should be always be planned in conjunction -- they are, in fact, two separate processes. 
4. **What is cloud backup and recovery, and how does it enhance data security?**
    - Cloud backup and recovery is the process of back up data to the cloud and restoring the files if an emergency occurs. The benefits of a cloud environment is similar to an offsite location meaning that back up is safely separated from the main and unlikely to be affected by any emergency. Additionally cloud backups can be automated and be "set and forget". 
5. **In some cultures, the concept of data privacy is highly valued, while in others, sharing information openly is considered normal. How might these cultural norms affect the way individuals approach data backup and disaster data recovery? Provide examples to support your response.**
    - While I can understand where the question is coming from, data privacy has, in my opinion, little to do with backups and disaster recovery. Transparency is not a preventative measure against malicious threat actors, or other emergencies, that may destroy, corrupt, or damage the data a business uses to operate. Regardless of whether if an organization is private or open, backups are still a necessity to ensure they can continue to function.

## Things I Want to Know More About
Would it be possible to create my own backup server to store snapshots of my computer? What about automating an Ubuntu (or any other linux) setup without the use of images but through a script/s?
