## Cloud Virtualization with AWS ([link](https://www.joe0.com/2017/06/11/importance-of-virtualization-in-the-amazon-ec2-cloud/))

1. **How has virtualization evolved beyond desktops and servers?**
    - It has gone onto now include virtualization of networks, storage, data device, even software encapsulation.
2. **In the context of the Amazon IaaS Cloud Service Model, what does EC2 stand for?**
    - Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2)
3. **What types of storage does EC2 use, and how is EC2 web traffic managed?**
    - EC2 uses either Ephemeral (temporary) storage or Elastic Block Storage snapshots that are stored in Amazon S3. 
4. **What are the benefits of service-oriented architecture for customers of EC2 virtualized services?**
    - It allows for a variety of different virtual machines of various sizes to be run on Amazon's hardware and offers their customers the ability to control virtualization through a web interface, as well as the entire system through APIs. 
5. **Analyze how cloud virtualization can promote equitable access to technology resources across diverse populations. How can this technology bridge cultural gaps and empower underserved communities?**
    - Virtualization and the cloud subsidizes computing to those without the resources for an enterprise environment with a lot of computers or high-end computers. It allows for computing to be leveraged at scales that small companies and communities may not be able to achieve and with a large company, like Amazon and Google, it can drive the cost down to make it affordable for a much wider clientele than before. In many ways it recreates the days of the mainframe and dumb terminals but at potentially global scale, meaning an internet connection and cheap hardware is all that is necessary to utilize cloud computing and virtualization.
