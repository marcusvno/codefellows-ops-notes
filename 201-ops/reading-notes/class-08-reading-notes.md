1. **What is the Windows Registry, and what does it store?**
    - The Windows Registry is a collection of databases used by Windows (and other programs) to store their configuration settings. Editing the registry can enable hidden features and tweak specific options. These tweaks are known as *registry hacks.* 
2. **What are the two types of registry settings stored for each Windows user account?**
    - System-wide registry settings that apply to all users and each Windows user account has its own user-specific settings.
3. **What are *registry hacks* and why might someone want to use them?**
    - *Registry hacks* are tweaks and changes to the registry to unlock hidden features or to added functionality that isn't normally available.
4. **What are some common tasks you can perform by editing the Windows Registry?**
    - Display a Message at Sign In
    - Clean up your Context Menu
    - Add Any Application to Desktop Context Menu
    - Add "Open with Notepad" to Context Menu for All Files
    - Stop Other User Accounts from Shutting Down Your PC
    - Block User Accounts from Running Specific Apps
5. **Imagine youâ€™re explaining the concept of the Windows Registry to someone who has never used a computer before. How would you make this explanation culturally relevant and relatable to their life experiences or background?**
    - The Windows registry is a bookshelf that holds cookbooks. Some cookbooks have blank pages, or are written in pencil, allowing you change some of the recipes to your specifications but that is dependent on the cookbook authors. Some books are necessary and detail where all your kitchen tools and appliances are stored. While you can edit these you may lose track of your necessary items and be unable to cook entirely.
