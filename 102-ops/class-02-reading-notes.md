## How to Build a Computer ([wikiHow link](https://www.wikihow.com/Build-a-Computer))
## Why It Matters
Understanding the hardware parameters of a computer will assist not only with troubleshooting physical hardware but also lead to an understanding of what Virtual Machines and Cloud servers are simulating and the constraints and parameters they operate under as well. 

1. Which is better in a CPU, more cores or higher speed? Under which circumstances is that true? How many CPU cores does a computer need?
 * The higher the CPU speed allows for the CPU to process data faster. Six cores is more than sufficient for most computers unless you are building a high performance gaming PC. Due note that software is another limiting factor when it comes to the number of cores a computer utilize. For instance, popular and industry video editing software Adobe AfterEffects (AE) was not engineered to utilize multiple cores so if you  find yourself doing a lot of video work with AE it would be better for a high GHz CPU with a lower core count. Be sure to research what works best with what you intend to use the computer for! 
2. What details are you looking for when finding a motherboard which fits your processor?
* Compatibility is the name of the game here. The motherboard must have the appropriate socket for the CPU otherwise they will not work together. 
3. What are the tradeoffs you’d evaluate while selecting a storage device?
* HDDs have become incredibly cheaper although they do not have the lightning fast read/write speeds of an SSD. A cheap alternative to an SSD only computer is to use a split: a smaller SSD for your Operating System and programs and a HDD for storage of large files such as video and documents and software that doesn't need a fast drive to function well. 
4. Think about others with a background similar to yours. How would you explain to them the key parts of a computer, in a way they’d best connect with?
* As a former Cavalry Scout, I'd compare a computer to a vehicle (such as the Hummvee). The CPU is the engine which runs everything. Secondary but nearly as critical is the power supply which acts as the fuel for the PC. The Vehicle chassis is similar to the computer case. The engine compartment is similar to the motherboard. And the pedals, steering wheel, and shifter are the user-interface peripherals used to input commands and control the PC, like a mouse and keyboard.

## Things I Want To Know More About
While I've built my own computer before, this has given me more in-depth knowledge of everything rather than just following a guide. In the future, I'd like to have an even better understanding of the components and the differences between interations of the same components; such as the difference between DDR3 RAM and DDR4 or 5.
