## Why It Matters
ISO files are the common format for Linux and Windows installation media. 

## What is an ISO File? ([link](https://www.lifewire.com/iso-file-2625923))
1. **What is an ISO File?**
   - An ISO file (or disc image file) is a file that represents a digital copy of an entire CD, DVD, or BD. 
2. **How do you write an ISO file to a CD, DVD, or removable media (like a thumb drive)?**
   - You can write an ISO file to media either using built-in software like Windows 10's isoburn.exe or third-party software like Balena Etcher or Rufus. 
3. **How do you create an ISO file?**
   - You can create an ISO file with the use of software but you must have access to the original media in its original form, such as a DVD optical drive to access a DVD. Then it is simply a matter of using one of many free tools available online to create a disk image file locally. 
4. **How do you mount an ISO file?**
   - Most modern systems have built-in functionality to mount an ISO file and present as if you had inserted a disk into a CD/DVD drive. Right-click the ISO and select Mount (in Windows) or Open With Disk Image Mounter (in Linux) and it you should appear.
   - However, this mounted disk drive is only available while the OS is running and if you are needing access to the contents of the ISO from outside the OS (like a recovery media) then it is best to flash the ISO onto a USB drive.


## Things I Want To Know More About
Linux has command line applications for dealing with ISOs such as `dd` but it was way more technical than using something like Rufus or Etcher. I'd be curious to learn more!
