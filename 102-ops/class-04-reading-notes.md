## Installing Ubuntu ([link](https://web.archive.org/web/20220312030901/https://www.lifewire.com/beginners-guide-to-ubuntu-2205722))
## Why It Matters
Linux is one of the most prevailing server operating systems and the industry standard for cybersecurity tools through distributions such as Kali.

## Questions
1. What is Ubuntu?
   - Ubuntu is a flavor or distribution of Linux, an open source operating system. Ubuntu itself is built upon the rock solid foundation of Debian and is currently one of the most utilized versions of Linux in the world.

2. Why would you choose to install the LTS version over regular Ubuntu releases?
   -  The LTS (or Long Term Support) version of Ubuntu is better suited for users who do not need to be on the cutting edge of releases or do not want to constantly have to upgrade or update their operating system. LTS releases are known for the stability while being slightly behind on updates to software packages.
3. What is the Ubuntu GNOME Shell?
   - The Ubuntu GNOME Shell is the default desktop environment for Ubuntu. Other flavors of Ubuntu such as Xubuntu, Kubuntu, and Ubuntu MATE utilize different desktop environments (XFCE, KDE, and MATE, respectively) which provide different user experiences (UX), utilities, and may be lighter weight for systems with lower or older hardware.
4. How do I install software from the command line?
   - The command line (CLI) while not as naturally intuitive as the graphical user interface (GUI) is a powerful tool and capable of improving a user's workflow speed dramatically. One such way is through the installation of files using the `sudo apt install` command which instructs the OS to execute the `apt install` command as a superuser. Apt is the default Ubuntu package manager and it can download, install, and update software packages that are downloaded from Ubuntu package repository servers. 

## Things I Want to Know More About
The command line. While I've used it a little in the past, I know I've barely scratched the surface of the things it can do and how useful it can be. It is also my understanding that it is a significant part of Kali's toolset and familiarity with the CLI can only pay off big dividends later.
